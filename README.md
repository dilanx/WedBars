# WedBars

This is the port of WedBars to the more modern 1.13+ API. It is currently under development and **is not suitable for production use**. It will be updated to 1.17 once more dependencies are updated.

Note that this version of WedBars is primarily developed for the latest release version of Minecraft (1.16.5), and as such future support for older versions is not guaranteed.

This version uses Maven 3.8.1 and Java 16.
